# AI-HOG-FaceDetection
This repository presents a Python implementation of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for face detection. It details the process of image preprocessing, gradient computation, orientation binning, and block normalization, demonstrating HOG's utility in AI-based image processing.
